Work in progress!

This repository contains examples of Wobbly Center Algorithm.

The main code files are hosted inside the examples folder.

### TODO:
1. Adding the performance of random sampling in the graph in WCA KS 
2. Instead of choosing only the points based on distance from the mean, we can try to use distance from all the points in the cluster
3. Instead of KS test for p_value, we can try other tests to see the performance
